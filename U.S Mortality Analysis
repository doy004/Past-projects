## Question 1

Question 1 text here. #male have higher mortality rate with 96.757.

```{r}

df<- df %>%
  mutate(female_mr=female_deaths/female_pop*1000,
         male_mr=male_deaths/male_pop*1000,
         total_mr=total_deaths/total_pop*1000,)

  summarise(female_avg_mr=mean(female_mr),
            male_avg_mr=mean(male_mr))

```

\newpage

## Question 2

Question 2 text here.#The male-female difference is larger in 90-100 than 20-30. the male-female ratio of mortality rates is larger among 20-30 year-olds.

```{r}


df23<-df %>% filter(year==2023)

ggplot(df23,aes(x=age))+
  geom_line(aes(y=female_mr,color="Female"))+
  geom_line(aes(y=male_mr,color="Male"))


ggplot(df23,aes(x=age))+
  geom_line(aes(y=log(female_mr),color="Female"))+
  geom_line(aes(y=log(male_mr),color="Male"))



```

## Question 3

Question 3 text here.
# No because the age structure has changed for the past 30 years. crude rate change change 11% to 9% and not considering the age structure, so most likely this is not the correct estimate.
```{r}

## Question 4

Question 4 text here.
# younger age such as age 10 and below has the most proportional decline, from age 20 we can see increase in mortality during COVID
```{r}

df10<- df%>%
  filter(age%%10==0 & age<=90)

ggplot(df10,aes(x=year,y=log(total_mr),color=factor(age)))+

## Question 5

Question 5 text here. #the age standardized graph shows bigger drops in mortality considering the effect of age structure.

```{r}

df232<-df23 %>%
  mutate(pop_share23=total_pop/sum(total_pop)) %>%

## Question 6

Question 6 text here.#Between 1933 to 2019, life expectancy at birth increased about 15%, while it dropped for about 10% during COVID.

```{r}

## Question 8

Question 8 text here.

Question 9 text here.

Question 10 text here.
#cohort life expectancy shows how much change when you have lived lifetime, while period life expectancy only show a snapshot or one's mortality rate.
```{r}
