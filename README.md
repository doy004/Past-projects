# Past Projects

This repository contains **data visualization and analysis projects** completed using **R** and related tools as part of my coursework and independent learning. These projects demonstrate skills in **data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and interpretation of demographic and economic data**, aligned with my interests in quantitative analysis and strategic decision-making.

## Projects Included

### üìä Population Visualization
- Visualizes global and country-level population trends.
- Demonstrates use of **ggplot2** for clear, layered data visualizations.
- Includes interpretation of demographic changes and their potential economic impacts.

### üìà U.S. Mortality Analysis
- Analyzes U.S. mortality data by age, region, and year.
- Applies **data cleaning**, **summary statistics**, and **trend visualization**.
- Explores relationships between demographic shifts and public health.

### üåç World Fertility
- Examines global fertility rates across time and regions.
- Includes data merging and cleaning workflows in **tidyverse**.
- Visualizes cross-country differences and trends.

### üìù Education and Employment
- Course problem set templates demonstrating systematic workflow for **reproducible analysis** in R Markdown.
- Includes **code, outputs, and interpretations** in a single file for clarity and transparency.
